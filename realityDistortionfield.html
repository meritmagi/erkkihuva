    <div class="columnLeft">A reality distortion field (RDF) is a phenomenon in which an individualâ€™s intellectual abilities, persuasion skills and persistence make other people believe in the possibility of achieving very difficult tasks. </div>
    <div class="columnMiddle">There are two sides to the reality distortion field. The positive is that it demonstrates how Steve Jobs bent reality in such a way that a difficult or impossible task was made to appear possible, or even easy. The primary objective of this technique was to inspire employees and motivate them to tackle challenging situations in pursuit of an objective or goal.
    </div>
    <div class="columnRight">The flip side is that the distortion field was Steve Jobs' darker side. Many considered him so driven that he would lie, pester, cheat or do whatever it took to succeed. In this light, a cynic would point to RDF as Jobs' ability to manipulate people to do what he wanted.</div>
